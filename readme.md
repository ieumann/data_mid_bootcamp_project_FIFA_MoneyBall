## FIFA 21 Analysis

### Project Description
I am conducting an end-to-end analysis of the FIFA 21 dataset (*fifa21_male2.csv*). The analysis includes a linear regression aiming at resolving the problem **"Rank Forward Players by Market Value"**.
This mini project is part of the IRONHACK Data Analysis bootcamp from January to June 2023.

### Usage Instructions
The repository contains both the original dataset provided for the mini project and the reduced dataset after cleaning and processing (*df_processed.csv*) as well as a Jupyter notebook with the analysis and the model (*FIFA21_analysis-and-documentation.ipynb*).
