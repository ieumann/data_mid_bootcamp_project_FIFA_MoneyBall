## FIFA 21 Analysis

### Project Description
I am conducting an end-to-end analysis of the FIFA 21 dataset *(fifa21_male2.csv)*. The analysis includes a linear regression aiming at resolving the problem **"Rank Forward Players by Market Value"**.
The project is part of the IRONHACK Data Analysis bootcamp from January to June 2023.

### Usage Instructions
The repository contains both the original dataset used for the analysis and the reduced dataset after cleaning and processing *(df_processed.csv)*. Then a jupyter notebook with the analysis and the model.
